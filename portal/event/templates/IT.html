            INSPIRIT is a multifaceted demesne of culture that has been showcased as our department’s cultural fest. From the stage being set up, to the gates being covered in flowers, lights and beautiful posters made by the students, INSPIRIT did it all this past year on __ March 2023. 
The event embarked on with some wonderfully curated musical performances, followed by a picturesque dance performance featuring the theme “Youth”, incorporating Bengali folk, all performed by the departmental students. The Grand Fashion Show – “ALLURE” won hearts and applause as the students depicted the theme “Elements of Nature” through their confident performance on the runway. 
In between the performances, the anchors and alumni engaged in shedding some light on wisdom and experience. The showstopper of the night was none other than the renowned singer – Snigdhajit Bhowmik, whose performance mesmerized the crowd, engulfing them into a beautiful haze. 
The evening’s huge success was possible on account of the immense hard work by the faculty and students of the department. Hence, the department of Information Technology wishes to carry on with this enriching tradition for years to come!

Technology. The impoverished children from Ramakrishna Mission Anathbhandar were welcomed with open arms on our campus, as the whole sporting event was dedicated to helping them.
To make a fun activity for the children, the team arranged an art competition, providing them with materials which they used to exhibit their artistic qualities! Being awarded with goodies and prizes made them smile from ear to ear. Not only did they shine in arts but their participation in the sports activities filled everyone with immense joy. 
Apart from the children, the students also ardently took part in cricket, football, kabaddi, tug-of-war, footrace and sprint. The winners were awarded in a prize distribution ceremony for their incredible performance! But it wasn’t the winners who only shined, all the participants were basking in glory after performing with such incredible sportsmanship.

                            The celebration begins with the lighting of the lamp followed
                            by cultural events, skits, and other fun activities to reminisce

                            efforts of our teachers and mentors who have helped us
                            grow and learn.
